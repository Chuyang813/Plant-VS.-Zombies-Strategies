# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Our project use the mutual restraint of plants and zombies to create an ideal Plants vs. Zombies strategy. When each category of zombie appears on the field, one or two corresponding plants should be placed in the corresponding row as a way to combat the zombies.

## Team

* Allen Zhang

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
